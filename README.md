## Objective
Read a text file (one word per line) and output information about whether the word is composed of unique characters and then output each word in its sorted order. 

1. `isUniqueChar()` function determines if a string has all unique characters, complete this function.
2. Edit the `sortWord()` function so that uses the InsertionSort() function to convert all letters to lowercase and print out the sorted characters for the word.

Assume these functions will be called from the main function. To get you started you can use these two files as a starting point. Instructions for usage can be found in the [Example.java](Example.java).

You may use [input.txt](input.txt) as a test case. The contents of the input.txt file:

```
hello
world
Brooklyn
College
```

The output should look like: 
```
false
ehllo
true
dlorw
```


## Submission
Submit via the GitHub Classroom link.

## Grading
I will be looking for the following characteristics amongst other critera:

* That it works. That the Java file submitted compiles and gives an output. Should be expected output. You are welcome to attach an example of input and output for me to refer to that it works for your test case(s), however I will be using my own test case with lowercase alpha characters and numbers.
* Readability is important, so is the impression you want to give on your code. Try to use good principles of naming, use of comments, spacing, etc.
